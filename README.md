- 👋 Hi, I’m @simonterrywatson. Professional software developer and consultant since 2000. Started with C++ ATL/COM and still miss the simplicity sometimes. Currently doing a lot of front end dev but anything goes really. Problem solving is the bit I enjoy, be it front end, back end, people, process or anything else. 
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, physics, astrophysics, cycling and alotmenteering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning something that caught my eye last week probably.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, taking it easy by juyst working and playing and not adding too much extra to the mix.
- 📫 How to reach me. Email on githubpm@simon.thewatsonhouse.co.uk
